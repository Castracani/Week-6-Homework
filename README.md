# Week-6-Homework
GIPHY API

On loading the page, there are a list of buttons comprised of different school subjects, as well as an input box to add whatever subject you might like to add. You aren't limited to rote school subjects however; any type of input is accepted! On clicking **"Submit Search"**, a new button with your search will be added to the top of the page. Clicking any of the buttons will populate the page with 10 GIFS's along with their age-appropriate rating. Two GIF's are given to a row, for a total of 5 rows. Requesting another subject/input will delete the GIF's currently on the page and will populate the newly selected subject/input. 

This project was created to gain experience with pulling and retrieving data from API's, as well as to present it in an aesthetically pleasing format. Bootstrap and jQuery were utilized along with the Giphy API.
